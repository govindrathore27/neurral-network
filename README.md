# Neural-network-from-scratch
In this notebook I have tried to make the  basic building blocks required to make a simple architecture of neural network.
## Activations:- 
1.They basically decide whether the neuron should be activated or not. In artificial neural networks, the activation function defines the output of that node given an input or set of inputs.\
2.Types of activation function:-\
-Sigmoid \
-Relu(Rectified Linear Unit).
## Initialisation
In intialisation , I have intialised parameters using to two different types of intialisation :- \
-He intialisation.\
-Default intialisation.\
Creating classes and functions for forward pass,backward pass,parameter update using gradient descent.\
Thanks,\
